### About this project

SwitchPay started as a late-night coding vibe: shipping features fast, experimenting, and iterating.  
But the landing page and contact page were shaped based on early feedback from potential prospects.  
The idea was simple: build fast, listen carefully, and make sure the product speaks to real needs.
